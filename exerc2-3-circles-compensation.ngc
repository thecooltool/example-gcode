(Training file for 3 circles with same diameter but different tool compensations: without, g1 and g42)
(Note that first you need to define a 1.6mm tool in tool table and then restart emc2!)

m06 t55 (select tool 55: t55 = 1.6mm end mill in tool table)
g0 z2
g0 x-5 y0

(circle 1, without compensation, made from two half circles)
g1 z-1.6 f50
g2 x-15 y0 i-5 j0 f100 (clockwise half circle with endpoint)
g2 x-5 y0 i5 j0 f100   (clockwise half circle with endpoint)
g0 z2


(circle 2, no endpoint defined->one full circle , with compensation g42 -> right side compensation seen in direction of cutting, therefore first positioning outside of circle required, then compensation on, then startpoint of circle)

g0 x-10 (positioning)
g42 (compensation on)
g0 x-20 (startpoint of circle)
g1 z-1.6 f50 
g2 i-5 j0 f100 (clockwise circle)
g1 z2
g40 (compensation off) 

(circle 3, no endpoint defined->one full circle, with compensation g41 ->left side compensation seen in direction of cutting, therefore first positioning inside of circle required, then compensation on, then startpoint of circle)
